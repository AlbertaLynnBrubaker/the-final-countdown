                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Alie Brubaker. I am an aspiring software engineer attending Flatiron School online as a student. I hope to learn everything I need to launch an exceptional career developing software and setting me on the right path to achieve professional excellence.</p>
                <p>I was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and moved all over western Canada until my family immigrated to the United States in 1996. I grew up in the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, MN where I gradutated high school.</p>
                <p>I came out as transgender when I was 28 and began hormone replacement therapy right before my 29th birthday. Being transgender has not been especially easy but I am fortunate to have the support of my friends and family which has given me the self confidence and stability to pursue a career.</p>
                <p>I hope my less common perspective helps me add value wherever I land in tech and I am excited to see where this new opportunity takes me!</p>
